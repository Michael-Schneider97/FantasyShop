Text based prototype for a game idea. This will iron out the game loop.

# Description of game loop

 * The game world will consist of a store with inventory containers. The player must sort, store, buy, and retrieve inventory. 
 * Orders will come from *characters*. 
 * Characters are NPCs who will have some quest they will be preparing for or returning from. Their requests will be relevant to what sorts of quests they are doing or have done. 
 * As characters do more quests they will level up and want more high-level items. 
 * The player can only obtain higher level items by upgrading their store. 
 * On top of managing the inventory, the player will need to manage costs against revenue.
